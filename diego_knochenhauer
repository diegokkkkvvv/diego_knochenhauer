# What I Learned

**What I learned:**  
In this task, I learned how to use GitHub to manage repositories, create markdown files, and open pull requests. I also experimented with different text styles using Markdown.

**What I'm still confused about:**  
I'm still figuring out how to work with pull requests when there are merge conflicts. Additionally, understanding all the Markdown formatting options can be tricky.

### Text Styles
- **Bold Text**
- *Italic Text*
- ~~Strikethrough~~
- `Code Snippets`
- [Links](https://github.com)
